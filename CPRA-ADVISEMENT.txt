The California Public Records Act (CPRA) (Gov. Code, ยง 6250 et seq.) allows public access to appropriate records and information possessed by State government.

This California Highway Patrol (CHP) site requires manual submission of e-mail addresses and search queries in order to deliver requested SWITRS data. Please note that manually submitted e-mail addresses and search queries become public records. As such, they are subject to inspection and copying by members of the public, unless an exemption in law exists.

Use of this Web site is voluntary.

The CPRA provides alternative ways to obtain SWITRS data that do not require manual submission of an e-mail address or search query. Please refer to CHP's 'Public Records Act Guidelines' at http://www.chp.ca.gov/pdf/pr_guidelines.pdf. CPRA requests for inspection or copies of records do not require personal identification unless the requestor wishes to receive delivery of copied records.
